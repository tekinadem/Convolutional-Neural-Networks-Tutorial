# Convolutional-Neural-Networks

## What are Convolutional Neural Networks?
Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet or CNN) is a special type of Neural Network used effectively for image recognition and classification. They are highly proficient in areas like identification of objects, faces, and traffic signs apart from generating vision in self-driving cars and robots too.

The architecture of a ConvNet is analogous to that of the connectivity pattern of Neurons in the Human Brain and was inspired by the organization of the Visual Cortex. Individual neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the Receptive Field. A collection of such fields overlap to cover the entire visual area.
